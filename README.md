# Car-price-prediction
I used machine learning modules to complete this project.
This project uses machine learning to predict the price of a used car.
The model is trained on a dataset of historical car sales data, and it can then be used to predict the price of a car based on its features.
Predicting car prices is a continuous machine learning problem. Therefore, the following metrics that are useful for regression problems are taken into account.
This is a python project for building a linear regression model that is used to predict used car prices from a given dataset using machine learning.
End-to-end ML project for predicting car prices based on various features. Includes data preprocessing, model training, and a Flask web for predictions.
Finally, I have done the project on car price prediction by using of machine learning.
